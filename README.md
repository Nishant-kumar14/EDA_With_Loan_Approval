# EDA With Loan Appoval🏦
## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhansing/bank-loan2
### About This Project📄
In this assessment, you will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) on a dataset related to home loan approval. The dataset is
sourced from Skill Circle and contains valuable information for
analysis. The primary focus of this assessment is on data
exploration and visualization machine learning techniques are not
required.

###  The goals of this assessment are to:🥅
* Gain familiarity with the dataset.
* Perform data exploration and visualization.
* Identify patterns, trends, and potential insights.
* Generate meaningful visualizations to communicate your findings.
### Project Tasks🚶‍♂️
#### Task 1: Data Exploration👓
* Load the dataset into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
* Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
* Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
* Summarize basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
for the numeric columns
#### Task 2: Data Visualization👁️
##### 2.1 Univariate Analysis
* Explore the distribution of numeric columns using the following visualizations:
 1. Histograms: Plot the frequency distribution of key numeric variables.
 2. Box Plots: Identify potential outliers and visualize the spread of
    data.
* Analyze categorical variables by creating the following plots:
 1. Bar Charts: Visualize the frequency distribution of categorical
    variables.
 2. Pie Charts: Represent the composition of categorical variables.
##### 2.2 Bivariate Analysis
 * Create scatter plots to explore relationships between pairs of numeric
variables.
 * Use pair plots (scatter matrix) to visualize interactions between
multiple numeric variables
simultaneously.
 * Investigate the relationship between categorical and numeric
variables using box plots
##### 2.3 Multivariate Analysis
* Perform a correlation analysis to identify relationships between
numeric variables. Visualize
correlations using a heatmap.
* Create a stacked bar chart to show the distribution of categorical
variables across multiple
categories.
### Conclusions and Recommendations:📃
Summarize the key findings and draw conclusions based on
the insights gained from the analysis.
